Python has been an object-oriented language since it existed. Because of this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.

If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts.

However, here is small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to bring you at speed −

## Overview of OOP Terminology

Class - A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.

Class variable - A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.

Data member - A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.

Function overloading - The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.

Instance variable - A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.

Inheritance - The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.

Instance - An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.

Instantiation - The creation of an instance of a class.

Method - A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.

Object - A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.

Operator overloading - The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.
